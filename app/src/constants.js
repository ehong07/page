  'Born and raised in the drastically underrated city of Cleveland in the great state of Ohio (with a 3 year stopover across '
    + 'the globe in Singapore to defrost from Cleveland winters), I solidified my Midwestern-ness while studying economics at '
    + 'Northwestern University before catching the coding bug and migrating west akin to an IRL version of my favorite game '
    + 'as a child, The Oregon Trail.',
  'Settling in San Francisco, I embarked on a professional journey through multiple sectors of the tech industry including '
    + 'EdTech, FinTech, and HealthTech before taking on a side quest by co-founding a lubricants consultancy.',
  'Iâ€™m enthusiastic about JavaScript, the React ecosystem, full-stack development, and developer experience. In my free '
    + 'time, you can find me pondering the artful yet fleeting nature of the golf swing, moving barbells through various planes '
    + 'of motion, and attempting to stuff as many dumplings as humanly possible into my stomach.',
